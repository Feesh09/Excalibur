# Excalibur

---

Excalibur is determined to show that not everything is forever. We have no intention of deploying Excalibur, but just remember that it exists so nothing is impossible. Main code in Excalibur will be locked so no one except the developers can deploy it. Most code will be accesible to display it abilitys, but not enough to be used for harm.
